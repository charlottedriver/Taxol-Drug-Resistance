# Taxol Drug Resistance in Breast Cancer

## Objective

## Data
This dataset (which I found on Kaggle) is collected from NCBI-GEO datasets:
- GSE144113 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE144113)
- GSE76200 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76200)
- GSE12791 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE12791)

Paclitaxel (or Taxol) is a type of chemotherapy that is used to treat a number of different cancer types. 
The data is the result of gene expression analysis of cell lines of four paclitaxel-resistant cells - BAS, HS578T, MCF7, and MDA-MB-231 - and control cells.
